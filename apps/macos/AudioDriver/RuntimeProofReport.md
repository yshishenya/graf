# Runtime Core Audio Proof Report

**Status**: NOT RUN

This report is the required evidence gate before any US1 implementation task
that publishes real virtual devices or installer behavior.

## Evidence Requirements

Fill this report only after running the runtime proof on an Apple Silicon Mac.
One machine result unlocks architecture work; it is not release-candidate matrix
coverage.

Required evidence:

- Date:
- Machine:
- CPU architecture:
- macOS version:
- Proof command:
- Build artifact:
- Virtual device publication result:
- `2brain Rec Microphone` visible to macOS:
- `2brain Rec Speaker` visible to macOS:
- Self-routing rejection baseline:
- Passthrough/mirror exercised:
- Continuity signal exercised:
- Permissions/signing/notarization assumptions:
- Known limitations:
- Decision: Core Audio path accepted, rejected, or still blocked.

## Current Result

Runtime Core Audio publication has not yet been proven. The current C++ proof
command validates only scaffold expectations and does not publish macOS devices.
