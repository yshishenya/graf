# Specification Quality Checklist: Cabinet Web Split

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details beyond necessary boundary constraints
- [x] Focused on product safety, maintainability, and behavior preservation
- [x] Written for maintainers and product owners
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic where practical for a refactor
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No unnecessary implementation detail leaks into specification

## Notes

- Initial validation passes. The spec intentionally allows route-family modules or equivalent local boundaries, while forbidding behavior changes and risky cross-boundary cleanup.
