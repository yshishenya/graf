# Specification Quality Checklist: Авторизация и доказательства автозаписи

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before clarification and planning
**Created**: 2026-08-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions are identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary, alternate, exception and recovery flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into the specification

## Notes

- Feature 124 remains the owner of the timer and target-scoped UX; this slice hardens authorization, readiness, audit semantics and validation.
- No critical product ambiguity remains before `$speckit-clarify`; planning must still research the canonical workspace-policy and acknowledgement persistence surfaces.
